# Housou-data

This directory contains the data generated by the [Housou Project](https://github.com/lukebeck/housou), 
which collects information on morpheme frequency from [NHK](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/).

All data is currently raw, containing entries including `続きを読む`, punctuation marks, specific times, dates, etc.

As this is a new project, current frequency ratings are unrepresentative, as can be seen by the prominience of words 
like 台風12号. Parsing more articles will not solve this issue, only doing so over a longer period of time.
